This repository showcases an end-to-end machine learning project for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project implements a complete data science workflow, from exploratory data analysis and advanced feature engineering to model tuning and evaluation. The result is a high-precision **CatBoost** model optimized for real-world business applications.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to develop a highly accurate and reliable model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset from **Capital One's Repository**. The final **CatBoost** model achieves **80% precision** on the validation set. This level of precision is crucial in a business context, as it minimizes false positives and enables a fraud investigation team to focus its efforts on high-confidence alerts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Developed sophisticated features including account tenure, time-based transaction patterns, and key financial ratios to capture complex fraudulent behaviors.
* **Robust Preprocessing Pipeline:** Implemented a custom `ColumnTransformer` pipeline that combines `TargetEncoding` for high-cardinality categorical features and `RobustScaler` to effectively handle outliers in numerical data.
* **Class Imbalance Handling:** Utilized the **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the severe class imbalance in the training data, ensuring the model learns to identify rare fraud cases.
* **Comparative Model Analysis:** Conducted in-depth training and hyperparameter tuning for Logistic Regression (Baseline), XGBoost, and CatBoost to identify the best-performing algorithm.
* **Optimized Decision Threshold:** Moved beyond the default 0.5 threshold by tuning the model's decision point to maximize the F1-score, striking an optimal balance between precision and recall for the business problem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Core Libraries:** Python 3.x, Pandas, NumPy
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A thorough EDA revealed crucial insights, including a severe class imbalance and a heavily skewed distribution of transaction amounts. Log transformation was applied to normalize the transaction data, which significantly improved modeling performance.

### 2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
This stage focused on creating high-impact features and preparing the data for modeling. Key steps included:
* Creating flags for suspicious activities like rapid multi-swipes.
* Engineering time-based features such as account age and days until card expiration.
* Applying **SMOTE** to the training data to generate synthetic samples of the minority (fraud) class.

### 3. Model Training and Tuning
Three powerful classification models were trained and systematically evaluated:
1.  **Logistic Regression** (as a baseline)
2.  **XGBoost**
3.  **CatBoost**

Each model's hyperparameters were fine-tuned using `RandomizedSearchCV` with cross-validation to optimize performance.

## üìà Results and Business Impact

The final analysis revealed a clear trade-off between precision and recall. While some models could identify a higher number of fraud cases (high recall), they generated too many false alarms, which is inefficient for a business.

The champion model, **CatBoost**, was selected for its exceptional **precision of 80%** after threshold tuning. This means that **4 out of 5 transactions flagged by the model are genuinely fraudulent**. Such high precision provides a reliable, high-confidence alert system that allows a fraud investigation team to work efficiently and minimize losses.
