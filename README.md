## üöÄ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a highly accurate and reliable model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a real-world dataset, the project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow. The final model, **CatBoost**, achieves **80% precision** on the validation set, making it highly effective for minimizing false alarms and allowing a fraud investigation team to focus on high-confidence alerts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Creation of sophisticated features like account age, time-based patterns, and financial ratios.
* **Robust Preprocessing:** A custom pipeline that includes `Target Encoding` for categorical features, `RobustScaler` to handle outliers, and `SMOTE` to correct for severe class imbalance.
* **Comparative Model Analysis:** In-depth training and tuning of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and CatBoost models.
* **Threshold Tuning:** A custom evaluation class was used to find the optimal decision threshold based on the F1-score, moving beyond default settings to maximize model performance in a real-world scenario.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
* **XGBoost & CatBoost:** For advanced gradient boosting models.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For analysis and code development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A deep dive into the dataset revealed key transaction patterns, time-based trends, and a severe class imbalance. The distribution of transaction amounts was heavily skewed, requiring a log transformation to normalize it for better modeling performance.

### 2. Feature Engineering & Preprocessing

Created new, impactful features and built a robust preprocessing pipeline to prepare the data for modeling. This included:
* Flags for suspicious activities like multi-swipes.
* Time-based features such as account age and days to card expiration.
* A `ColumnTransformer` pipeline with `RobustScaler` for numerical features and `TargetEncoder` for high-cardinality categorical features.
* Application of **SMOTE** to the training data to handle the severe class imbalance.

### 3. Model Training and Tuning

Three models were trained and evaluated:
1.  **Logistic Regression** (Baseline)
2.  **XGBoost**
3.  **CatBoost**

Each model was tuned using `RandomizedSearchCV` to find the optimal hyperparameters.

## üìà Results & Conclusion

The final analysis highlighted a trade-off between precision and recall. While some models could catch more fraud (high recall), they did so at the cost of many false alarms.

The champion model, **CatBoost**, was selected for its outstanding **precision of 80%** after threshold tuning. This means that 4 out of 5 transactions flagged by the model are indeed fraudulent, providing a high-confidence alert system for business use. The confusion matrix below illustrates its strong performance.

This high-precision model is ideal for real-world deployment, as it ensures that the fraud investigation team's time is spent on legitimate alerts.
